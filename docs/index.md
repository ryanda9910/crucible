features:
  - icon: 🎨
    title: DESIGN.md — Ground Truth
    details: Color tokens, typography rules, spacing scale, and a forbidden anti-pattern list. Every AI session reads this before touching any UI.

  - icon: 🧠
    title: GUARDRAILS.md — Institutional Memory
    details: Every mistake documented. SVG optimizer bug, broken form patterns, tap target violations — logged once, never repeated.

  - icon: 🧩
    title: 9 UI Libraries
    details: Tailwind (default), shadcn/ui, Ant Design, Material UI, Mantine, Chakra UI, daisyUI, Bootstrap, or plain CSS. Deps injected and providers wired automatically.

  - icon: 🤖
    title: AI Skills System
    details: Role-based Claude Code constraints. /copywriter enforces voice rules. /qa-mobile runs the tap-target checklist. /ui-designer enforces design tokens.

  - icon: 🔒
    title: Token Enforcement
    details: Script blocks hardcoded hex values at commit time. Design consistency enforced by the build system, not discipline.

  - icon: ⚡
    title: 4 Frameworks
    details: Next.js 14, Astro 4, Vite + React, Vanilla JS. Same AI system — different runtime. Pick what fits your stack.
